    <p class="description__main-content--title">The Bees Knees</p>
    <p class="description__main-content">The Bees Knees is a pop rock band 
        originating from San Francisco, California. 
        The band consists of lead vocalist Bryan 
        Teddy, guitarist Mack Tolkens, guitarist 
        Andrew Green, bassist Kent Zulkee and 
        drummer Freddie Fischer. The band 
        achieved its first commercial success as an 
        unsigned act, drawing attention from 
        manager Cam Adams. Having worked with 
        other popular acts (The Elephant In The 
        Room, One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), 
        Adams was confident the band could 
        succeed even further, pushing them to sign 
        with Magenta Records.</p>
    <p class="description__main-content">
From there, the band has soared, gaining 
international recognition and ranking in the 
top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans 
immediately fell in love with the band’s 
original and organic attitude, solidifying 
their place as one of the hottest and fastest 
up and coming acts of this century. Fans 
affectionately refer to themselves as “The 
Hive” and are drawn to their candid and 
authentic performances on stage. Looking 
forward to touring in the future, The Bees 
Knees are currently recording their second 
studio album, looking to be released in late 
2021
